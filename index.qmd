Greetings! I'm Jack. Junior and Economics major at Pomona College. Formerly of Class of 2024, finally back at school after serving in the Republic of Korea Army Special Forces. My interest lies in the world of finance and value investing. Love to play soccer (lifelong Arsenal fan) and love to share my military endeavors. This is a space to test my analytical skillsets.
