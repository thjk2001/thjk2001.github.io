In fact, fans and analysts alike do pay enormous attention to the designated referee for each fixture. As a lifelong Arsenal fan, I wanted to find out which referees tend to be harsher on Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart represents the total number of yellow cards each referee has given to Arsenal. Craig Pawson handed out the most yellow cards to Arsenal, with 9 cards given."
