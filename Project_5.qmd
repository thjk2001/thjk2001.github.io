## Overview of Project



Are departure delays significantly different between morning and evening flights?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(DT)
```

## nycflight2013 Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create a new table from original to add a new column indicator morning or evening flight
flights <- nycflights13::flights |>
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) |>
  mutate(time_of_day = case_when(
    hour >= 5 & hour < 11 ~ "morning",
    hour >= 17 & hour < 23 ~ "evening",
    TRUE ~ "other"
  )) |>
  filter(time_of_day != "other")  # Exclude flights that are not in the morning or evening


# Display the first 5 rows as an interactive table
datatable(
  flights[1:5, ],  # Select the first 5 rows
  options = list(
    pageLength = 5,      # Display 5 rows per page
    dom = 't',           # Show only the table (no search box, etc.)
    scrollX = TRUE       # Enable horizontal scrolling
  ),
  caption = "First 5 Rows of Flights Data"
)

```


Mornings: 5:00am ~ 11:00am

Evenings: 5:00pm ~ 11:00pm


## Observed Difference in Mean Delay



```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

mean_delays <- flights |>
  group_by(time_of_day) |>
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

mean_delays |>
  kable(
    caption = "Mean Departure Delay by Time of Day",
    col.names = c("Time of Day", "Mean Delay (minutes)"),
    align = c("l", "c")
  ) |>
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
obs_diff <- flights |>
  group_by(time_of_day) |>
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay)) |>
  summarize(diff = diff(mean_delay)) |>
  pull(diff)

```



```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Observed Difference in Mean Delays (Morning - Evening):", obs_diff, "minutes\n")
```


## Permutation Test and Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(47)

null_dist <- map_dbl(1:1000, ~ {
  flights |> 
    mutate(shuffled_time = sample(time_of_day)) |> 
    group_by(shuffled_time) |> 
    summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay), .groups = "drop") |> 
    summarize(diff = diff(mean_delay)) |> 
    pull(diff)
})


```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(null_dist), aes(x = null_dist)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_diff, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Permutation Test: Morning vs Evening Delays",
    x = "Difference in Mean Delays",
    y = "Frequency"
  )

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Calculate p-value
p_value <- mean(abs(null_dist) >= abs(obs_diff))

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")
```

## Conclusion

Observed difference is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true.

Strong evidence to reject null hypothesis: red line falls outside the range of the simulated null distribution values.

Potential generalization into other mega airports in US:

+ Chicago (ORD, MDW)
+ Los Angeles (LAX)
+ Atlanta (ATL)
