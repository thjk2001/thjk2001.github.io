Objective: Let's find out which nations are represented the most in the top 10 most successful athlete list (measured by medal count). Which countries have produced the best talents?

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-08-06')

olympics <- tuesdata$olympics
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

top_athletes <- olympics |>
  filter(!is.na(medal)) |>
  group_by(name, team) |>
  summarise(total_medals = n()) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(total_medals)) |>
  slice(1:10)

top_athletes

top_nations <- top_athletes |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))

top_nations
```
USSR and United States produced the highest number of most successful athletes.
